# US_HOUSE_PRICE_FACTORS

Task - Using publically available data for the national factors that impact the supply and demand of homes in the US, build a model to study the effect of these variables on home prices.

In this, we used the below dataset ( which is publically available on the Internet)


    1)Unemployment Rate
    2)Per Capita GDP
    3)Construction Prices
    4)CPI
    5)Interest Rates
    6)Number of new houses supplied
    7)Working Population
    8)Population
    9)Percentage of population above 65

Most of the data is downloaded from [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/].


As a proxy for home prices, the S&P CASE-SHILLER Index is used.
